A program that will take a string in, then rebuild it with SI symbols from the periodic table.

This is my response to the [Spelling with Chemistry](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/5seexn/20170206_challenge_302_easy_spelling_with/) prompt from /r/dailyprogrammer.



## Sample Output:

Enter a word that you would like to spell with SI symbols:
>functions

This string cannont be built from SI symbols. []
